<p style="color: yellowgreen;font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;"> JAVA is a well-known object-oriented programing language. It was created by Sun Microsystems Inc through a team of researchers known as the Green Team which led by James Gosling. Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton were also on the team.  The purpose was to allow <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Java-computer-programming-language" style="color:yellowgreen;"> consumer electronic devices to communicate with each other.</a> James Gosling and his team started to work on developing the language in June 1991. It was released in 1995.  
    Originally, the name of the program lanuage was to be Oak. The programming language then became known as First Person when American cable operators joined it. However, it still had no success. It did not get speed until the release of the HTTP Brower and Mosaic Protcol in 1993. Here is how <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-history" style="color: yellowgreen;">an article</a> describes it:
    <blockquote cite="https://www.baeldung.com/java-history" style="color:yellowgreen;font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">
        In 1993, the HTTP protocol and the Mosaic browser arrived, which was a crucial event for the project. During this time, the team realized that the Internet would be the ideal network to position their product.

          Then, in 1995, James Gosling unveiled a browser called WebRunner that was capable of showing HTML content mixed with Applets. Things took off from there. First, WebRunner became HotJava, then java.sun.com officially opened to the public.

    </blockquote>
     <p style = "color:yellowgreen;font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">Eventually, the programming language was named JAVA (which, as the article from Baeldung reports, means coffee in american slang). It is now one of the most popular and famous programming languages with different aspects and different versions released. For a history of the various verisons, go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history" style= "color:yellowgreen;">here.</a>
